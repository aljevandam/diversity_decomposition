This repo contains the code used to generate the data and figures for the paper 'Diversity and its decomposition into variety, balance and disparity'.

The extraxt_details.txt file contains the details of the data extract from IPUMS-USA (Steven Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Ronald Goeken, Josiah Grover, Erin Meyer, Jose Pacas, and Matthew Sobek. IPUMS USA: Version 9.0 [dataset]. Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS, 2019. https://doi.org/10.18128/D010.V9.0)
